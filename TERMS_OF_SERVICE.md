## 1) 🔍 Service Description
- Excalibur provides automation for security and moderation on Discord servers.
- Key features: anti-spam, anti-raid, anti-nuke, heuristic threat detection, configurable security levels.
- Features may change, be updated, or removed over time.

## 2) ✅ Eligibility and Authorization
- The Bot can only be used in accordance with Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- End users and server administrators using the Bot are deemed to accept these Terms.
- The Bot is provided only via Discord; self-hosting, distribution, or re-publishing is prohibited.

## 3) 🚫 Acceptable Use
The Bot is not designed for misuse and cannot be used for malicious purposes. It does not offer features to perform such actions and cannot be configured to do so.

- The service is provided solely for security and moderation purposes in compliance with Discord rules.
- If clear abuse is detected, access to the Bot may be restricted for the affected servers.

## 4) ⚙️ Features and Automated Actions
- When a threat is detected, automated actions may occur (warnings, mute, ban, role removal, etc.).
- Actions depend on your server configuration and selected security levels.
- Automated actions may be irreversible; configure carefully and review periodically.

## 5) 🔐 Data Processing and Privacy
- The Bot may process limited technical data to provide security/moderation (user/server/channel IDs, message content/metadata, event logs, rate-limit counters).
- Data is used only for security/moderation, retained only as necessary, and preferably for short periods (e.g., Redis cache, logs).

## 6) 🧩 Third Parties and Dependencies
- The Bot operates using Discord API and third-party software (PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, etc.).
- Outages or changes in third-party services may affect the Bot’s operation; liability is limited in such cases.

## 7) ⚠️ Disclaimer
- Excalibur’s primary purpose is to support and help protect your server in terms of security and moderation.
- For full and correct operation, place the Bot’s role **above other roles** in the role hierarchy to grant necessary administrative/moderation permissions.
- If the Bot’s role hierarchy/permissions are insufficient, it may not be able to perform certain actions (e.g., remove roles, mute/ban users). In any attack/damage attempt, if the Bot lacks required permissions, the developer is not responsible for resulting issues.
- The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available" without guarantees of fitness for a particular purpose, uninterrupted operation, or error-free performance.
- The developer is not liable for direct or indirect damages arising from the use of the Bot.
- The accuracy and appropriateness of moderation decisions are the responsibility of server administrators.

## 9) 🔚 Termination
- Access may be restricted or terminated if misuse or security risk is detected.
- Users may stop using the Bot at any time.

## 10) ©️ Intellectual Property and License
- The Bot and related materials are proprietary; all rights reserved. Source code is not publicly available.
- These Terms grant you a limited, revocable right to use the Bot solely via Discord.

## 11) ⚖️ Governing Law
- Disputes may be governed by the law of the developer’s location, subject to mandatory consumer protection rules.
- Discord’s contracts and policies also apply and take precedence.

## 12) 📮 Contact
